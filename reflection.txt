Overall, I had a lot of trouble with this project, a lot more than I thought I would. It was definitely a very different experience from the social network . The main thing that I struggled with was backtracking, but once I figured that out everything worked. I fixed the issue by adding every move the pacman made and then putting it into a path variable, which was then returned when the pacman found the goal node. Some strategies and resources I used were going to office hours, my notes, stack overflow, and discussing with classmates about possible ways to write the search algorithm.
